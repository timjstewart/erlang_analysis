Ruby Scripts for analyzing Erlang Code

Requirements:

  ruby

Installation:

  chmod +x imports
  chmod +x exports

Running:

  ./imports                # parse all erlang source files in current directory
                           # and display their imports in colon delimited format

  ./imports -t             # parse all erlang source files in current directory 
                           # and display their imports as a tree.


  ./exports                # parse all erlang source files in current directory 
                           # and display their imports in colon delimited format

  ./exports -t             # parse all erlang source files in current directory 
                           # and display their imports as a tree.

  ./imports -t -e          # parse all erlang source files in current directory 
                           # and display their imports as a tree (excluding OTP
                           # modules).

  ./erefs module:function  # parse all erlang source files in current directory
                           # and print all modules that call module:function

  ./erefs function         # parse all erlang source files in current directory
                           # and print all modules that call function regardless
                           # of the module.
